/**
 * Job-level failure bounds for the preview/mix/render WebView lanes, in one
 * place so every clock's value and its error message stay in step and the
 * calibrated pairs stay calibrated (a start grace must fit inside the job
 * budget it guards).
 *
 * What these bounds are NOT: they are not activity deadlines by themselves —
 * the host components own the timers; here live the numbers, the derivation,
 * and the messages. Fixed timers never gate decode/analysis steps; every
 * message path is event-driven and these bounds only cap *loud failure*, so
 * a healthy job that legitimately needs the budget always finishes.
 *
 * The shared reasoning behind the 60 s / 180 s pair (research, not guesses):
 *
 * - Served soundtracks stream up to 200 MB, and `decodeAudioData`
 *   materializes the whole file as float32 PCM. A slow-compressed 200 MB MP3
 *   is hours of audio — gigabytes of float32 — so that class of file dies of
 *   *memory* first (the renderer is killed and the job rejects loudly via
 *   `onRenderProcessGone`, already handled). Wall time is only the binding
 *   constraint for files that fit memory, and those decode in minutes at the
 *   very worst even at ~10x realtime.
 * - `OfflineAudioContext.startRendering()` allocates its entire output
 *   AudioBuffer up front (Microsoft Edge's WebAudio incremental-rendering
 *   explainer documents this: "startRendering() allocates an AudioBuffer
 *   large enough to hold the entire rendered WebAudio graph before
 *   returning" — a 2-hour, 4-channel render is gigabytes). A full-length
 *   mix here is at most a 600 s stereo render (~230 MB float32), and offline
 *   rendering runs faster than realtime, so the render + level computation
 *   itself is tens of seconds.
 *
 * 180 s therefore covers fetch + decode + offline render + level math for
 * every input that does not die of memory first, with headroom; inputs that
 * do die of memory already fail loudly through a different path.
